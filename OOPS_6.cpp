/*
    Friend Function

    1) Friend Function is NOT a Member Function of a class to which it is a friend.
    2) Declared in the Class with Friend Keyword and defined outside the class to which it is friend.
    3) Shouldn't be defined using membership level.
    4) It has no caller objects.
    5) Can access any member of the class to which it is friend.
    6) Cannot access member of the class directly.

    Why we need this ?

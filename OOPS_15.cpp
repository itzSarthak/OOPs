class A

    void f1(){}
     void f2(){cout<<"Parent Class !!"<<endl;}

    void f1(int x){}
    void f2(){cout<<"Child Class!!"<<endl;}

int main()

    A *ptr;
    // pointer of type parent class can store address of any of its decendents.

    A obj1;
    B obj2;

    ptr = &obj2;
    ptr->f2();  
    /*
        This should call f1() of class B but due to early binding f1() of class A is being called.
        Bcz at compile ptr is of type 'A' !!

        Early Binding --> type of Pointer.
        Late Binding --> content of Pointer.

        To avoid that we can use virtual keyword in parent class.
        Now all the function with same name and signature became virtual function.




        # Concepts of vptr & vtable !!

        ** When Pointer is of type 'parent' and object is of type 'child' then only
        ** virtual functions are relevantðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–
